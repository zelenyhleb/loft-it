## Language-Oriented Frameworks and Tools: Integrity Tests

A small helper tool which generates integrity tests for LOFT::RGM specification model written in Rust.

**IMPORTANT**
This is **not** a validation tool, thus it does not need to be infitely precise. 
It just helps us to avoid lots of copy-paste work on boilerplate integrity tests code.
